# opensource
definition of opensource
Open source software is usually easier to obtain than proprietary software, often resulting in increased usage. Additionally, the availability of an open source implementation of a standard can increase adoption of that standard.[40] It has also helped to build developer loyalty as developers feel empowered and have a sense of ownership of the end product.[41]
